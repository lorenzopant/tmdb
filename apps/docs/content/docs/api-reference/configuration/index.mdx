description: Query system-level configuration data from TMDB, including image settings, countries, languages, timezones, and more.
---

The `ConfigurationAPI` provides access to system-level data from TMDB — things like valid image
sizes and base URLs, supported countries, languages, timezones, and department/job listings. We provide static
data for some of the configuration values, such as countries and languages, so you can choose to use our typed values
of fetch these details and cache them. Most of this data is static and changes infrequently, so it's a good candidate for caching.

```ts
import { TMDB } from "@lorenzopant/tmdb";

const tmdb = new TMDB("your-api-key");
tmdb.configuration; // access methods

// or standalone
import { ConfigurationAPI } from "@lorenzopant/tmdb";
const config = new ConfigurationAPI("your-api-key");
```
