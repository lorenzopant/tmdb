# TV Series Lists

The `TVSeriesListsAPI` provides access to curated TMDB TV series lists.
All methods return a paginated list of [`TVSeriesResultItem`](/docs/types/search#tvseriesresultitem).

```ts
import { TMDB } from "@lorenzopant/tmdb";

const tmdb = new TMDB("your-api-key");
const { results } = await tmdb.tvSeriesLists.popular();
```

## Methods

- [`airing_today()`](/docs/api-reference/tv-series/lists/airing-today) — Get TV shows airing today.
- [`on_the_air()`](/docs/api-reference/tv-series/lists/on-the-air) — Get TV shows airing in the next 7 days.
- [`popular()`](/docs/api-reference/tv-series/lists/popular) — Get TV shows ordered by popularity.
