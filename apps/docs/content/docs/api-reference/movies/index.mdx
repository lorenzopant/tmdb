The `MoviesAPI` provides access to all movie-related data from TMDB —
from full details and credits to images, videos, and streaming availability.

```ts
import { TMDB } from "@lorenzopant/tmdb";

const tmdb = new TMDB("your-api-key");
const movie = await tmdb.movies.details({ movie_id: 550 });
```
