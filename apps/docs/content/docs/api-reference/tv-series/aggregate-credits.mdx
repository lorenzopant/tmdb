Get the aggregate credits (cast and crew) for a TV show across all seasons and episodes.
This is the same view shown on the TMDB website, as opposed to [`credits()`](/docs/api-reference/tv-series/credits)
which only returns the latest season data.

```ts
async aggregate_credits(params: TVAggregateCreditsParams): Promise<TVAggregateCredits>
```
