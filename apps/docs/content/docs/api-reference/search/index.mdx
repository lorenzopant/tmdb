The `SearchAPI` provides full-text search across all major TMDB entity types.
All search methods require a `query` parameter and return paginated results.

```ts
import { TMDB } from "@lorenzopant/tmdb";

const tmdb = new TMDB("your-api-key");

// or standalone
import { SearchAPI } from "@lorenzopant/tmdb";
const search = new SearchAPI("your-api-key");
```
