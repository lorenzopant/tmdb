description: Supported country codes for localizing TMDB results by region.
---

The `region` option accepts an **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** country code. It localizes content
including release dates, age certifications, watch providers, and filtered lists like
"now playing" or "upcoming".

```ts
const tmdb = new TMDB(apiKey, { region: "IT" });
```

If not set, TMDB may return global or non-regionalized data.
