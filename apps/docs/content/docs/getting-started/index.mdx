### Install

```npm
npm install @lorenzopant/tmdb
```

### Create TMDB object

```ts title=tmdb.ts
export const tmdb = new TMDB("<your-tmdb-apikey>");
```

### Use TMDB methods

Once you've initialized the `TMDB` client, you can start using the API methods. Here's how to search for a movie:

```ts
const results = await tmdb.search.movies({ query: "Inception" });
console.log(results.results);
```

You’ll get a paginated response with a list of matching movies, including their titles, poster paths, IDs, and other metadata.
