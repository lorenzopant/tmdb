description: Shared types used across multiple API methods.
---

These types are shared across multiple API namespaces. Rather than duplicating definitions,
they are centralised here and referenced throughout the API reference and other type pages.

- [Params](/docs/types/common/params) — Parameter utility types used across multiple query methods, such as `WithLanguage`, `WithPage`, and `WithRegion`.
- [Media](/docs/types/common/media) — Types representing core media entities such as genres, credits, images, videos, watch providers, and more.
