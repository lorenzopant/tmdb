description: Type definitions for the ConfigurationAPI responses.
---

These types represent the data structures returned by the [`ConfigurationAPI`](/docs/api-reference/configuration) methods.

---

## `ConfigurationResponse`

The top-level response returned by [`configuration.details()`](/docs/api-reference/configuration/details).
Contains image configuration settings used to construct valid image URLs.

<AutoTypeTable path="/config/configuration.ts" name="ConfigurationResponse" />

<Callout type="info">
	The `images` field is the primary reason to call `configuration.details()` — it provides the live base URLs and valid size options
	directly from TMDB, which may differ from the static constants exported by this package.
</Callout>

---

## `ImageConfiguration`

Describes the image hosting configuration returned by TMDB, including base URLs and all
supported sizes for each image type. Used within [`ConfigurationResponse`](#configurationresponse).

<AutoTypeTable path="/config/configuration.ts" name="ImageConfiguration" />

<Callout type="tip">
  Prefer `secure_base_url` over `base_url` in all production environments.
  Combine it with one of the size arrays and a file path to build a complete image URL:

```
https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/{size}/{file_path}
```

For example: `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/abc.jpg`.
See the [Images configuration reference](/docs/getting-started/options/images) for the full list of size constants.

</Callout>

## `ConfigurationLanguage`

Represents a single language entry as returned by
[`configuration.languages()`](/docs/api-reference/configuration/languages).
Each entry corresponds to a language TMDB has recorded in its database.

<AutoTypeTable path="/config/configuration.ts" name="ConfigurationLanguage" />

<Callout type="info">
	This differs from the [`Language`](/docs/types/language) type used in request parameters. `ConfigurationLanguage` is a **response
	shape** describing a language entry; `Language` is the **input type** used to filter or localize API responses.
</Callout>

---

## `ConfigurationCountry`

Represents a single country entry as returned by
[`configuration.countries()`](/docs/api-reference/configuration/countries).
Country codes follow the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) standard.

<AutoTypeTable path="/config/configuration.ts" name="ConfigurationCountry" />

<Callout type="info">
	For the list of country codes accepted as **input** (e.g., the `region` option), see the
	[`CountryISO3166_1`](/docs/types/options/region) type.
</Callout>

---

## `ConfigurationTimezone`

Represents a single timezone entry as returned by
[`configuration.timezones()`](/docs/api-reference/configuration/timezones).
Each entry maps an ISO 3166-1 country code to one or more
[IANA timezone](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) identifiers.

<AutoTypeTable path="/config/configuration.ts" name="ConfigurationTimezone" />

<Callout type="info">
	For the `Timezone` type used as a constructor option, see the [Timezone types reference](/docs/types/options/timezone).
</Callout>

---

## `ConfigurationJob`

Represents a single department and its associated job titles, as returned by
[`configuration.jobs()`](/docs/api-reference/configuration/jobs).
These are used throughout TMDB to categorize crew members on movies and TV series.

<AutoTypeTable path="/config/configuration.ts" name="ConfigurationJob" />
