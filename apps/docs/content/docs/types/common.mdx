import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

These types are shared across multiple API namespaces. Rather than duplicating definitions,
they are centralised here and referenced throughout the API reference and other type pages.

## Params

These utility types are used as parameters across multiple API methods. They are derived from
`TMDBQueryParams` using `Pick`, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.

### `TMDBQueryParams`

The base parameter type from which all utility param types are derived.

<TypeTable
	type={{
		language: {
			description: "ISO 639-1 or primary translation code for localized responses.",
			type: "Language",
			default: "en-US",
		},
		page: {
			description: "Page number for paginated results.",
			type: "number",
			default: "1",
		},
		region: {
			description: "ISO 3166-1 country code to localize results.",
			type: "CountryISO3166_1",
		},
	}}
/>

---

### `WithLanguage`

A parameter type for methods that accept a `language` override.

<TypeTable
	type={{
		language: {
			description: "ISO 639-1 or primary translation code for localized responses.",
			type: "Language",
			default: "en-US",
		},
	}}
/>

---

### `WithPage`

A parameter type for methods that support pagination.

<TypeTable
	type={{
		page: {
			description: "Page number for paginated results.",
			type: "number",
			default: "1",
		},
	}}
/>

---

### `WithRegion`

A parameter type for methods that accept a `region` override.

<TypeTable
	type={{
		region: {
			description: "ISO 3166-1 country code to localize results.",
			type: "CountryISO3166_1",
		},
	}}
/>

---

### `WithLanguagePage`

A parameter type for methods that accept both a `language` override and pagination.

<TypeTable
	type={{
		language: {
			description: "ISO 639-1 or primary translation code for localized responses.",
			type: "Language",
			default: "en-US",
		},
		page: {
			description: "Page number for paginated results.",
			type: "number",
			default: "1",
		},
	}}
/>

---

### `DateRange`

A parameter type for methods that accept a date range filter.

<TypeTable
	type={{
		start_date: {
			description: "Start date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).",
			type: "string",
		},
		end_date: {
			description: "End date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).",
			type: "string",
		},
	}}
/>

---

### `WithParams`

A generic utility type that picks one or more keys from [`TMDBQueryParams`](#tmdbqueryparams).
Used internally to construct all the `With*` types above.

```ts
type WithParams<T extends keyof TMDBQueryParams> = Pick<TMDBQueryParams, T>;
```

---

## Pagination

The `PaginatedResponse` type wraps all list-based API responses that support pagination.

### `PaginatedResponse<T>`

A generic wrapper returned by any endpoint that paginates its results.
The `results` array type varies per endpoint — refer to each method's return type for the specific item type.

<TypeTable
	type={{
		page: {
			description: "The current page number.",
			type: "number",
		},
		total_pages: {
			description: "Total number of pages available.",
			type: "number",
		},
		total_results: {
			description: "Total number of results across all pages.",
			type: "number",
		},
		results: {
			description: "Array of items for the current page.",
			type: "T[]",
		},
	}}
/>

<Callout type="info">
	TMDB caps pagination at **500 pages** regardless of `total_pages`. Requests beyond page 500 will return an error.
</Callout>
